            <h2>About Me !</h2>
            <p>Hello ! My name is Emily Larson. I was born and raised in Northern Utah and currently live there with my
                husband. I have been a high school physics teacher for the last four years. I love learning new skills
                like painting,
                cross-stitch,
                and video games. </p>

            <h2>How I Met My Husband</h2>
            <p>I met my husband Trevor the old fashioned way,
                through a dating app. We had both gotten onto it due to COVID and going a little stir-crazy stuck
                indoors. We met outdoors at a park and had a picnic while chatting for several hours. We found out that
                we both had weekly dnd games going. From there we dated and played a dnd campaign together. Our
                characters got married the day before we did ! </p>
